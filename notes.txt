put in section in readme about local/private configs

don't allow setup_config to be called twice, input parameters break then.

Mark classes / properties as final? For properties, it would be cool to just
do them as uppercase, which is python convention.
Mark them as strict? @config_class(strict=True). If one tries to overwrite attribute throw error


Interface classes? Where the attributes are set to anyfig.placeholder and throws error if its not overwritten? anyfig.required

option to save anyfig as pickle, txt, source


Could we fix so that if you name a configclass the same as a class (module.classname), all those parameters becomes defaults for the class. Is this argument-injection?

Put some info in website about sensitive files. Could be user-settings or files with passwords

Also put in some best practices - like try to keep the config simple and keep main logic in actual program.

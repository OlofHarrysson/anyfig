Change target to check for class and change to callable? Not that the object is callable but the definition?

Implement accessing config values with square brackets/get(name, default_value)? __get_item__

name wrangling with double underscore? __build_target

Possibly to hash config class to make sure that other config is exact the same? Loading for example

Some kind of help string about the program that can be sent to init_config or places in a config?

A way to control which arguments that can be overwritten by cli/visible by the --help. I don't see a good way to do this that doesn't require lots of maintainence for the user. Better to do an opt-in system than an opt-out, so whitelist the ones you want exposed

input arguments for functions. Could maybe check if old value is function, if so, take the function with the input argument name from the old argument module's namespace

Move to cookiecutter repo to help with pip package

Save and load
option to save anyfig as pickle, source
Option to save as json - how to deal with non-json classes? Have anyfig.config_class(json_compatible=True) which forces the config to only keep json compatible fields e.g. python literals

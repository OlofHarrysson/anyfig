Have the class inherit from MasterConfig instead of transfering functions possible? Might play better with IDEs

Support json - Have it work out of the box for configs that are pure json-types. Offer ability to extend.

Versioning support - I'd like to create a way to keep track of / load old configs. Something like a versioning system. Perhaps save this information alongside the config, or create a config-component that has the versioning elements and can be added into a mainconfig. Could add git information via gitpython (or show users how to do it). I like a built in versioning config-class that can save version number, creation time, git commit, maybe the entrypoint script filename


Can I use the "with" statement to maybe say with Anyfig.OnlyOverwrite(self) or something to make sure that people don't add new attributes in configs instead of overwritting existing attributes?
What other context-managers?

license as a button in github

Assume unchanged instead of that ignore thing in git for user configs? It had some problems when changing branches as git couldn't handle.

command line tab autocomplete?

Json/Yaml serialization. Use json-pickle?
a = 1
b = 2
inner = InnerConfig()

{
  __anyfig_config_class = MainConfig 
  a = 1
  b = 2
  inner = {
    __anyfig_config_class = InnerConfig
    innnnn = "in"
  }
}

put in section in readme about local/private configs

Would like to be able to use dataclasses structure. Its possible now but the type hinting is needed, and its not enforced so just seems bad to use.

make it so __repr__ is ambigious


Mark classes / properties as final? For properties, it would be cool to just
do them as uppercase, which is python convention.
Mark them as strict? @config_class(strict=True). If one tries to overwrite attribute throw error


Interface classes? Where the attributes are set to anyfig.placeholder and throws error if its not overwritten?
Can maybe use __slots__ = ('x', 'y'), see https://blog.usejournal.com/a-quick-dive-into-pythons-slots-72cdc2d334e
Maybe not, it seems static or something?

Support json - Have it work out of the box for configs that are pure json-types. Offer ability to extend.

Versioning support - I'd like to create a way to keep track of / load old configs. Something like a versioning system. Perhaps save this information alongside the config, or create a config-component that has the versioning elements and can be added into a mainconfig. Could add git information via gitpython (or show users how to do it). I like a built in versioning config-class that can save version number, creation time, git commit, maybe the entrypoint script filename


Can I use the "with" statement to maybe say with Anyfig.OnlyOverwrite(self) or something to make sure that people don't add new attributes in configs instead of overwritting existing attributes?

Test frozen for nested obejcts

Move _frozen and other default attributes to a function so it's defined at one place

license as a button in github

when printing available classes in setup, only print the class, not the name.

Make target classes have a special attribute that holds the dict arguments? Good is that you can put other stiff in there, but bad is that it becomes another thing you need to remember about anyfig


type for target class for isinstance check


--help doesn't work with type hints

Would like to be able to use dataclasses structure. Its possible now but the type hinting is needed, and its not enforced so just seems bad to use.

Can do I want to remove the inheritence from anyfig.MasterConfig? It looks neater but might be a bit harder for people to grasp what is happening. I don't want it to inherit form masterConfig and then when people inherit other shit it breaks.

make it so __repr__ is ambigious


Should have a function to register the config object in the anyfig module which can later simply be imported anywhere. Singleton idea. No more passing around configs



Do we want to let users be able to create several configs? The fire/argparse doesn't work then. Unless we hook into that and divides it... But not for v1

Mark classes / properties as final? For properties, it would be cool to just
do them as uppercase, which is python convention.
Mark them as strict? @config_class(strict=True). If one tries to overwrite attribute throw error


Interface classes? Where the attributes are set to anyfig.placeholder and throws error if its not overwritten?

Expose to the commandline with --help

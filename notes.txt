What was the problem with dataclasses again?



Some kind of help string about the program that can be sent to init_config or places in a config?

Possibly to hash config class to make sure that other config is exact the same? Loading for example


input arguments for functions. Could maybe check if old value is function, if so, take the function with the input argument name from the old argument module's namespace


Mark classes / properties as final? For properties, it would be cool to just
do them as uppercase, which is python convention.
Mark them as strict? @config_class(strict=True). If one tries to overwrite attribute throw error.

Move to cookiecutter repo to help with pip package

option to save anyfig as pickle, txt, source

Could we fix so that if you name a configclass the same as a class (module.classname), all those parameters becomes defaults for the class. Is this argument-injection?


If a component1 has config options and dependencies on other components, it's hard to create the component1 without putting all its dependencies into the conifg as well. The dependencies don't have config-values so shouldn't be there. Either something like functools.partial. Or a config class that has component1 class definition and available config-values and a way (like anyfig function?) to easily create an object with config-values + non-config values.
Something like

  dataloder = config.data.dataloader.create(dataset=dataset)
  dataloder = config.data.dataloader(dataset=dataset)

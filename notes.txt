input arguments for functions. Could maybe check if old value is function, if so, take the function with the input argument name from the old argument module's namespace


Mark classes / properties as final? For properties, it would be cool to just
do them as uppercase, which is python convention.
Mark them as strict? @config_class(strict=True). If one tries to overwrite attribute throw error


Interface classes? Where the attributes are set to anyfig.placeholder and throws error if its not overwritten? anyfig.required

option to save anyfig as pickle, txt, source


Could we fix so that if you name a configclass the same as a class (module.classname), all those parameters becomes defaults for the class. Is this argument-injection?

Put some info in website about sensitive files. Could be user-settings or files with passwords


anyfig+argparse

Issues with dataclasses

1. Confusing to users new to dataclasses

@dataclass
class InnerConfig(MainConfig):
  yoyo = 2 # Local variable
  yo: int = yoyo * 2 # Need type hint for it to be an attribute

Answer https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/:
Type Hints
So far, we have not made a big fuss of the fact that data classes support typing out of the box. You have probably noticed that we defined the fields with a type hint: name: str says that name should be a text string (str type).

In fact, adding some kind of type hint is mandatory when defining the fields in your data class. Without a type hint, the field will not be a part of the data class. However, if you do not want to add explicit types to your data class, use typing.Any:


2. Doesn't call parent init unless parent is also dataclass (without overriden __init__). Doesn't work if parent isnt dataclass

@anyfig.config_class
class MainConfig():
  def __init__(self):
    self.save_directory = [1, 2]

@anyfig.config_class
class InnerConfig(MainConfig):
  yo: int = 1

config = InnerConfig() # Never calls super to MainConfig

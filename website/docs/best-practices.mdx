## Sensitive Information

Sensitive information such as passwords should most likely not be put into files tracked by git for security reasons. This creates a dilemma if one wants to track Anyfig config-class files but not the sensitive information within. 

A workaround would be to put the sensitive information in a file, have git ignore the file and point to the file from Anyfig.

```python
import anyfig

@anyfig.config_class
class MyConfig():
  def __init__(self):
    self.password_file = 'secrets/password.txt'

config = anyfig.setup_config(default_config=MyConfig)
with open(config.password_file) as file:
    password = file.read()
```

It's also possible to create a function to read the password from the file directly in an Anyfig config-class. If you prefer this approach, be careful for if you save the config, the password will be saved as well. 


```python
import anyfig

@anyfig.config_class
class MyConfig():
  def __init__(self):
    with open('secrets/password.txt') as file:
      self.password = file.read()

config = anyfig.setup_config(default_config=MyConfig)
```
